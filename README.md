```bash
git clone https://github.com/dirty-js/bacon.react.atom-examples.git
cd bacon.react.atom-examples
npm install
npm run build
```

Then `open public/index.html` file in your browser.

If you want to edit the code, you can also run `npm run watch` to auto build
when sources are changed.  You will need to manually refresh the browser.
